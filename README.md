# 📈 Linear Regression Model with Python

This project focuses on building and evaluating a **Linear Regression model** using Python to explore the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The objective is to apply foundational regression concepts for predictive analytics using real-world or simulated data.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Import and clean the dataset
- Build a simple linear regression model
- Train the model using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - R² score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visualize regression line and residuals

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Simple linear regression using `LinearRegression()`
- Data visualization for linear trends
- Residual analysis
- Model interpretation and prediction

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Run the code cells sequentially.
3. Modify the dataset path or variables as needed.
4. Interpret regression metrics and plots to understand model performance.
